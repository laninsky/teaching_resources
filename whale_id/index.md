### Why do we need to identify whale samples with DNA?

### How do DNA differences between species arise?

### Things this exercise should teach
This exercise touches on aspects of NCEA Level 2 and 3 Biology, including *2.5 Genetic variation and change (AS 91157)* (particularly 'sources of genetic variation' and 'genetic change') and *3.5 Demonstrate understanding of evolutionary processes leading to speciation* (particularly mechanisms of evolution, the origin of species, and patterns of evolution)

### Identifying whale meat with DNA
#### Using BLAST
#### Using 'Witness for the Whales'
