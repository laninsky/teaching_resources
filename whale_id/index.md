## Why do we need to identify whale samples with DNA?
Cetaceans (whales and dolphins) are super diverse and (mostly - with the exception of some dolphin and beaked whale species) easy to tell apart based on morphology - their appearance - because natural selection and drift have acted to make some very different looking critters. Here's just a few of the ~90 cetacean species!

So given they look so different, why would we need to identify species with DNA?  

Well...how about these whales and dolphins? Can you tell them apart?

Sometimes we can get samples that no longer look like the original dolphin or whale. This might be because the animal has been dead for a while (e.g. strandings) and no longer looks like it did while alive (this happens quite a bit in Aotearoa New Zealand!). Sometimes it might be because the animal has been cut up for food like in the whale meat example above. Sometimes it is because we recover bones from old whaling stations and we don't know what species they belong to anymore. In these cases, sometimes using DNA can help us figure out what species we have.  

Often, we use a kind of DNA called mitochondrial DNA, often known as mtDNA for short. More on that in the next section!

## Why do we use mitochondrial DNA?
Most of the time when we think about "DNA", we think of nuclear DNA, which is found in the nucleus in our chromosomes.  
![zooming into a cell and ending up at nucleotides](cells_nuclear_DNA.png)

This kind of DNA is biparental - you get one copy from your mum, and one copy from your dad. This "double-copy" kind of DNA is known as diploid DNA.  
![with nuclear DNA you get one copy from your mum and one copy from your dad](nuclear_DNA.png)

However, there are other kinds of DNA and one that is particularly handy for forensic identification of species is mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA. Unlike nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA is only inherited from your mum, which means almost everyone has the same kind of mtDNA as their biological mum. This "single-copy" kind of DNA is known as haploid.

The mtDNA hangs out inside mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. Some genes in the mitochondrial DNA encode for proteins. However, for our analyses we mostly use a specific locus - the control region - because it doesn't appear to be under as strong selection as the parts of the mtDNA that code for proteins.  
![Mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited](maternally_inherited.png)

Why is this important? Well, we know that the ultimate origin of all genetic variation is mutation. One of the reasons we particularly like to work with mtDNA is that it has a higher mutation rate, which means it accumulates variation more quickly than nuclear DNA.
![mutation is the ultimate cause of genetic variation](mutations.png)

But the control region is extra special. Because mutations in this locus are mostly neutral, they don't get removed from the population because of purifying/negative selection. Over time, this means that a bunch of mutations can build up that can distinguish different maternal lineages (kind of like a maternally-inherited surname). When we define certain stretches of DNA based on the mutations they hold, this is called 'haplotyping'.
![The proces of haplotyping mitochondrial DNA involves looking for differences when comparing the letters](haplotyping_mtDNA.png)

Over time, processes like natural selection,bottlenecks and genetic drift mean we can even use the mtDNA to distinguish different species!


Not only can the mtDNA distinguish different species, but it is also present in multiple copies per cell (because your cells have lots of mitochondria to power them, and each mitochondria has copies of mtDNA). Because there are lots of copies, it means that we are more likely to be able to successfully extract mtDNA and amplify the control region using PCR, even from samples that are degraded... like animals that have been decomposing on the beach for a while, or whale meat that has been canned, or a bleached bone that has been sitting at a whaling station for centuries.

## Things this exercise should teach
This exercise touches on aspects of NCEA Level 2 and 3 Biology, including *2.5 Genetic variation and change (AS 91157)* (particularly 'sources of genetic variation' and 'genetic change') and *3.5 Demonstrate understanding of evolutionary processes leading to speciation* (particularly 'mechanisms of evolution', 'the origin of species', and 'patterns of evolution')
