|  **Sample ID**  |         **Species ID from BLAST**                 | **Species ID from Witness for the Whales** | **Additional notes** |  
|  J08-021B       | *Balaenoptera physalus* (fin whale)               |  Same as BLAST                             |                      |  
|   J01-007       | *Balaenoptera bonaerensis* (Antarctic minke)      |  Same as BLAST                             |                      |  
|   J01-008       | *Berardius bairdii* (Baird's beaked whale)        |  Similar to Baird's beaked whale, but 'outside' of the rest of the samples                              |    Although this sample looks similar to a Baird's beaked whale, it seems to represent diversity not present in the Witness for the Whales database       |  
|   J09-011       | *Balaenoptera acutorostrata* (common minke whale) |  Specifically, a North Pacific minke                               |    Witness for the Whales gave us a more "fine-scale" answer than BLAST because of the use of a curated database       |  
|   J09-029       | *Megaptera novaeangliae* (humpback whale)         |  Humpback whale, but 'outside' of the rest of the samples                          |    Although this sample looks similar to a humpback, it seems to represent diversity not present in the Witness for the Whales database        |  


### Advantages and disadvantages of each approach
One advantage of BLAST is that the database is updated more frequently, so it has many more sequences for each species. For example, in the cases where our sequence is 'outside' the rest of the samples in the Witness for the Whales program, it could be because more recent sequences have not been added to that database, but have been added to BLAST, so Witness for the Whales is missing representative samples that cover the diversity of a given species. 

However, one of the downsides of BLAST is that these sequences are not expertly curated. If sequences have been uploaded with the wrong species identification, we could be misled if they match to our sequence of interest. Also, the expert curation in the Witness for the Whales dataset allowed us to 'zoom in' and see that the common minke whale was specifically from the North Pacific minke population.

## When can there be issues using mtDNA to identify species?
- DNA sequence too short: if the sequences used with either method are too short, we might not capture enough of the unique mutations that allow us to tell species apart
- Sometimes even with full-length sequences species cannot be distinguished. This isn't such a problem with the control region, but other parts of the mtDNA can be identical between different species
- When you have a new species! BLAST will still give you a match, but it might have a lower % of identity. In Witness for the Whales, the sample will show up 'outside' the samples from the most closely related species. It can be difficult to decide how different a sample has to be from other species to consider that it might be a new species!
