### Why do we need to identify whale samples with DNA?
Whales are super diverse and (mostly - with the exception of some dolphin and beaked whale species) easy to tell apart because natural selection and drift have acted to make some very different looking critters.
So why would we need to identify species with DNA?
Whale meat

### How do DNA differences between species arise?
Mutation, genetic drift etc

### Why do we use mitochondrial DNA?
What is mtDNA?
Multi-copy
Haploid
Maternally-inherited only

We use a specific locus - the control region - because it doesn't appear to be under as strong selection as elsewhere on the mtDNA. This means the mutations that occur are mostly neutral, which means they don't get removed from the population because of purifying/negative selection. Over time, this means that a bunch of mutations can build up distinguishing different species.

### Things this exercise should teach
This exercise touches on aspects of NCEA Level 2 and 3 Biology, including *2.5 Genetic variation and change (AS 91157)* (particularly 'sources of genetic variation' and 'genetic change') and *3.5 Demonstrate understanding of evolutionary processes leading to speciation* (particularly 'mechanisms of evolution', 'the origin of species', and 'patterns of evolution')

### Identifying whale meat with DNA
#### Using BLAST
#### Using 'Witness for the Whales'

### When doesn't this approach work?
Fragment too short  
Species can't be distinguished  
New species/variation
